### Developing

To successfully build the sources on your machine, make sure that you have the correct version of node along with one package manager installed. See `engines` in [package.json](/package.json) for details.

### Testing/Debugging

Execute `yarn run test` or `npm run test` in the repository root to run all tests.

If you want to run the connector on your local machine, execute `yarn run start:dev` or `npm run start:dev` which will start a new node server.
Make sure to set the proper environment variables when running the code locally.

## Running and writing tests

There are two sets of tests, unit tests and integration tests. Please use unit tests for all features testing. The purpose of integration tests is just end-to-end validation of functionality on sample applications.

Integration tests for the `SyncAgent` are organized in scenarios. Please see the [Test Scenarios Guide](/test/integration/scenarios/README.md) for a detailed description of the scenarios.
